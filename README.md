The primary objective of this project is to develop a Python-based Mashup Creator that automates
the process of downloading and combining multimedia content. Specifically, it aims to:

Create a system that downloads videos from YouTube, converts them to audio, trims them to a
specific duration, and merges them into a single audio mashup.
